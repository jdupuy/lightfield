Building the sources
--------------------

1 On Windows
	Just open the solution with vs2010, and press CTRL+F5.

2 On Linux
	In a terminal, type "sh configure.sh", then either:
	- "make config=release32" or 
	- "make config=release64" 
	depending on your system.
	You can get more options for build by typing "make help" 

Enjoy !
